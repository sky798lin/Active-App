# Active-App
A workout tracking app built in Java Spring Boot.

Main Features:
Users have the ability to build workout templates, selecting from a number of different exercises to fill their workout routine. Once created, these templates can be used to log and record data, such as the weight and reps performed for a certain exercise, to a persistant database built in MySQL. Users will then be able to view their progress for specific workouts or exercises by seeing their past performance.

Additional Features:
Once a user begins their workout a timer will begin recording the duration of their workout until they finish. Users can also start rest timers between their workout sets and add notes to specific exercises within their workouts. If workout templates are not to the users liking they can edit or delete any existing templates.
